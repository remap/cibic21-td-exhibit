## About CiBiC
CiBiC is an experimental transportation research project to encourage group bike commuting among residents of the Northeast LA neighborhoods of Chinatown, Solano Canyon, Lincoln Heights, Cypress Park, William Mead Homes, and adjacent areas. 

We’re asking people to try commuting to work on bicycles in small groups – a cheaper, healthier, more sustainable, and potentially more satisfying alternative to cars.

It’s like carpooling but on bikes!

CiBiC is a collaborative research project led by UCLA and funded by the National Science Foundation. CiBiC studies how to support bicycle commuting in L.A. Participation in the research involves bicycle commuting with groups of residents and expert mentors.
